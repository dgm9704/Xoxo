# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in the project!

Due to to my old-school opinionated workflow, I don't currently accept unsolicited pull requests.

Please instead create an issue with the following:
- Details about what is wrong or missing, exception details etc.
- Link to applicable documentation (taxonomy, Filing Rules, etc )
- A (preferably minimal) report or link to report that can be used to reproduce and test the issue

I will take a look and we can have a public or private discussion if needed.

If I think that the fix or change is something that should go in the library, 

I will then implement it, taking into consideration any suggestions.


# Breaking changes!
After starting to add support for xBRL-JSON it became obvious that the code needed restructuring.

So 3.0.0 comes with breaking changes to the naming and organizing of code. 

Different flavors are now in their namespaces Diwen.Xbrl.Xml, .Inline, .Csv, .Json, 

Diwen.Xbrl.Instance is now Diwen.Xbrl.Xml.Report and so on.

Test code was also similarly shuffled.

Functionally everything is still the same, performance wasn't affected etc.

Please get in touch if you can't find something, or if have questions or comments.

With regards to xBRL-JSON, I would be grateful for any actual "real world" samples! 

(of course it must be either publicly available or anonymized/fuzzed etc)


# Branched!
The library code is now in two branches:
- main: .NET 5+ version that will get new features etc. (version 2 upwards)
- legacy: .NET Standard 2.0 version that will only get critical bug fixes (versions 1.x)

# Xoxo
Container for the Diwen.Xbrl library and any related stuff

TLDR; 

You can use the compiled library with your application without it affecting the licensing of your other source code.
